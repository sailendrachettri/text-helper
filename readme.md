# Text-Utility ([txt-helper](https://txt-helper.herokuapp.com)) 

Text Utility is an React application that helps you to convert text into lower case or vice versa. I know this is quite basic but will add more functionality later.

While creating this application I learned about bootstrap, react-router-dom (to navigate from one page to another wihout reloading), jsx and writing styles in js format and lot more.

Two theme is available to the app, one is dark mode and light by default. Below is live site hosted on [Heroku](https://heroku.com)
